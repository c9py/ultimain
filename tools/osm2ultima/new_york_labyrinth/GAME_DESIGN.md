# Ultima: The New York Labyrinth

> *"Out of the frying pan and into the fire... The Avatar has escaped Pagan... now lost in a labyrinth they call 'New York'... what could go wrong..."*

---

## Prologue

The Titan of Ether lies defeated. The Black Gate is destroyed. But the Avatar's journey through the planes has taken an unexpected turn. The final spell of escape, cast in desperation, has torn a rift not through space, but through *time and dimension*.

The Avatar awakens on cold, hard stone—not the familiar cobbles of Britain, but something else entirely. Strange towers of glass and steel rise impossibly high, blotting out the sky. Metal carriages roar past without horses. The air tastes of smoke and strange magics. And everywhere, *people*—thousands upon thousands, rushing past without a glance.

This is not Britannia.

This is **New York**.

## The Eight Anti-Virtues of Manhattan

The Avatar soon discovers that this strange land operates on a twisted reflection of the Virtues. The denizens of New York unknowingly serve the **Eight Anti-Virtues**, each embodied by a powerful district:

| Anti-Virtue | District | Guardian |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Greed** | Wall Street | The Broker of Souls |
| **Pride** | Fifth Avenue | The Countess of Vanity |
| **Deceit** | Times Square | The Neon Oracle |
| **Cowardice** | The Subway | The Rat King |
| **Injustice** | City Hall | The Corrupt Magistrate |
| **Sacrifice** | Ground Zero | The Memorial Specter |
| **Dishonor** | The Docks | The Smuggler Baron |
| **Spirituality** | Central Park | The Green Guardian (ally) |

Only by confronting each Anti-Virtue and restoring balance can the Avatar find the way home.

## Key Locations

### Times Square - The Crossroads of Chaos
*"Where the Neon Oracle speaks in riddles of light..."*

The heart of the labyrinth. Massive glowing signs assault the senses—magical advertisements that entrance the weak-willed. The Neon Oracle dwells here, a being of pure light and deception who trades in half-truths and misdirection.

**Notable NPCs:**
- **The Neon Oracle** - Boss encounter, speaks only in advertising slogans
- **Street Performers** - Bards who know fragments of the old songs
- **The Ticket Scalper** - Black market dealer in passage tokens

### Wall Street - The Temple of Greed
*"Gold flows like blood through these stone canyons..."*

A fortress of commerce where the Broker of Souls trades in futures—literally. The souls of the desperate are bought and sold on the trading floor. The Avatar must navigate the treacherous world of "derivatives" (dark contracts) and "hostile takeovers" (literal sieges).

**Notable NPCs:**
- **The Broker of Souls** - Final boss of the district
- **The Analysts** - Seers who predict doom
- **The Interns** - Enslaved youth, potential allies

### The Subway - The Underworld
*"Beneath the city, the Rat King holds court..."*

A vast underground labyrinth of tunnels and stations. The Rat King commands legions of vermin and the lost souls who dwell in the darkness. The trains themselves are iron serpents that devour the unwary.

**Notable NPCs:**
- **The Rat King** - Commands the underworld
- **The Buskers** - Musicians who remember the old ways
- **The Mole People** - A hidden society who may aid the Avatar

### Central Park - The Last Sanctuary
*"In the heart of stone, a garden grows..."*

The only place in New York where the old magic still flows. The Green Guardian, last of the nature spirits, maintains this sanctuary against the encroaching concrete. Here, the Avatar may find rest, healing, and guidance.

**Notable NPCs:**
- **The Green Guardian** - Ally and quest-giver
- **The Joggers** - Pilgrims who circle the sacred paths
- **The Hot Dog Vendor** - Purveyor of mysterious meat

## New Mechanics

### The MetroCard
A magical artifact that grants passage through the Subway. Without it, the iron serpents will not stop for you. Can be recharged at special shrines (MetroCard machines) for gold.

### The Smartphone
A strange scrying device carried by all New Yorkers. The Avatar can acquire one and use it to:
- **Navigate** - Shows a map of the labyrinth
- **Communicate** - Contact NPCs remotely
- **Research** - Access the "Internet," a vast repository of knowledge (and lies)

### Reputation: Street Cred
Instead of Virtue scores, the Avatar builds "Street Cred" with various factions:
- **The Suits** (Wall Street)
- **The Artists** (Greenwich Village)
- **The Underground** (Subway dwellers)
- **The Tourists** (Wandering outsiders like yourself)

## Bestiary

| Creature | Location | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Taxi Golem** | Streets | Yellow metal beasts that charge at anything in their path |
| **Pigeon Swarm** | Parks | Seemingly harmless, but attack in overwhelming numbers |
| **Subway Rat** | Underground | Giant vermin, servants of the Rat King |
| **Street Mime** | Times Square | Invisible walls are very real |
| **Food Cart Elemental** | Everywhere | Smells delicious, attacks with scalding liquids |
| **Parking Enforcer** | Streets | Implacable, cannot be reasoned with |
| **The Jaywalker** | Intersections | Ghosts of those who crossed against the light |

## The Path Home

To escape New York and return to Britannia, the Avatar must:

1. **Gather the Eight Tokens** - One from each district, obtained by defeating or redeeming the Anti-Virtue guardians
2. **Restore the Ley Lines** - The city's grid pattern is actually a corrupted magical grid; realign it through Central Park
3. **Open the Portal** - At the top of the Empire State Building, where the barrier between worlds is thinnest
4. **Make the Choice** - Save New York from itself, or abandon it to its fate?
